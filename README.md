# Travel-Agency-Page-HTML-Exercise
A fake Travel Agency Page made using just HTML | 
*im a 17-year-old learning to code HTML with FreeCodeCamp. I completed an exercise on my own by following the guidelines they provided. This will be my second of hopefully many portfolio items!*
tbh i really struggled to complete this one and had to look for help.
